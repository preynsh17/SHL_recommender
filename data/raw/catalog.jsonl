This test is a face-valid, split-screen simulation that is designed to assess multitasking ability. It captures the dynamic nature of the working environment by presenting the candidate with multiple types of items in a timed format. Candidates will be required to complete problem-solving items that are presented on one side of the screen, while at the same time attending to emails that are presented within an email inbox on the other side of the screen.

This test is comprised of items that contain a passage that you must read in order to answer the question being asked. The questions focus on the candidate's ability to demonstrate an understanding of the passage. Questions may be specific in nature, with answers that can be found almost word for word in the passage. For example, the question may ask for a date, name or place that can be found by closely reading through the passage. Alternatively, the questions may be general in nature, with answers that can be determined only by fully understanding the meaning of the passage. \"What is the theme of the passage?\" or \"What is the mood of the author?\" are examples of general questions the candidate may be asked.

Home Products Product Catalog Reading Comprehension v2 Description The Reading Comprehension - English assessment provides a general measure of English reading comprehension. This test is comprised of items that contain a passage that you must read in order to answer the question being asked. The questions focus on the candidate's ability to demonstrate an understanding of the passage. Questions may be specific in nature, with answers that can be found almost word for word in the passage. For example, the question may ask for a date, name or place that can be found by closely reading through the passage. Alternatively, the questions may be general in nature, with answers that can be determined only by fully understanding the meaning of the passage. \"What is the theme of the passage?\" or \"What is the mood of the author?\" are examples of general questions the candidate may be asked.

Home Products Product Catalog Retail Sales and Service Simulation Description The Retail Sales and Service Simulation measures the ability of a candidate to choose effective sales and service techniques while interacting with customers. Situations are presented to the candidate via computer-based animation, and the candidate is offered a set of behaviors from which to choose the most and least effective responses. The behaviors vary in the extent to which the sales associate may: direct a conversation toward a commitment or sale, listen carefully to customers and provide options that address what they really need/want, put aside work to assist a customer, and focus on meeting customer needs. Responses are tracked and compared against expert ratings of effectiveness. The test produces an overall score, as well as scores on two subscales, Customer Service Effectiveness and Sales Effectiveness.

Home Products Product Catalog 360° Multi-Rater Feedback System (MFS) Description SHL 360, or the Multi-Rater Feedback System (‘MFS’), provides a holistic 360-degree view of an employee by gathering feedback from the employee’s manager, peers, direct reports, and/or other raters. By offering a wide range of perspectives, 360 feedback gives employees a more thorough understanding of not only their strengths, weaknesses, and development opportunities, but also their impact on others. 360-degree multi-rater assessments are based on SHL’s Universal Competency Framework (“UCF”), using our proven library of research-driven competencies to provide opportunities for managers, peers, and direct reports to supply useful developmental feedback that they may not otherwise share. SHL can also offer support and training throughout the entire process, from defining objectives through interpreting and delivering the feedback. 360 feedback serves all levels and industries and is a positive and powerful addition to your performance management system.
